# Contributing to the BioSimulations COMBINE archive test suite

We enthusiastically welcome contributions to the BioSimulations COMBINE archive test suite!

## Coordinating contributions

Before getting started, please contact the lead developers at [info@biosimulators.org](mailto:info@biosimulators.org) to coordinate your planned contributions with other ongoing efforts. Please also use GitHub issues to announce your plans to the community so that other developers can provide input into your plans and coordinate their own work. As the development community grows, we will institute additional infrastructure as needed such as a leadership committee and regular online meetings.
