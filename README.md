# BioSimulators test suite

This package contains two related resources:

* **Collection of example [COMBINE/OMEX](http://co.mbine.org/standards/omex) archives**: This collection is a reference for the community. The collection is also the test suite that [BioSimulators](https://biosimulators.org) uses to validate the capabilities of simulation tools.
* **Software for validating simulation tools**: This package also contains software for testing that simulation tools are compatible with the [BioSimulators standards for simulation software tools](https://biosimulators.org).
